Perhaps I might have some ability to read and follow directions?  Meh, probably not.  No.  Definitely not.

Ok, so here's the to do.

<ol>
<li>Pull the newest info i've put on development.</li>
<li>Check out a new branch called <b>CardClass</b></li>
<li>Set up a class here, called cards. Include a header and a implementation file.</li>
<li>Test / add / commit (push if you like)</li>
<li>Phase 1 - Set the vector to contain <code>cards</code>, and make <code>cards</code> a glorified wrapper of a public integer. This will allow you to easily test without worrying about accessibility.</li>
<li>Test / add / commit (push if you like)</li>
<li>Phase 2 - Set the public integer in <code>cards</code> to be private. Now it's real. Now you need several things:
<ol>
 <li>A setter - how is the card set? There are several options:
 <ol>
  <li>Constructor - in example, <code>Card c(52);</code></li>
  <li>Assignment - in example, <code>Card c = 52; </code></li>
  <li>Function call - in example, <code>Card c; c.Set(52);</code></li>
 </ol>
 </li>
 <li>A getter - how can i access the card? Again, several options.
 <ol>
 <li>Assignment operator - let's not do this yet. Kthx.</li>
 <li>Display function - some public member function can return the value. If you choose this, the main program will need to be modified.</li>
 <li>A stream writer operator - i may smash this together for you since it's a bit advanced for what we're doing here. Work on (ii).</li>
 </ol>
 </li>
 <li>A drink. Definitely a drink.</li>  
 </ol>
 </li>
 <li>Test / add / commit.</li>
 <li>We'll add more later :)</li>
</ol>
